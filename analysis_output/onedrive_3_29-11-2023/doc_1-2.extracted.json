A Frontex vessel intercepted a migrant boat in Greek territorial waters, which then proceeded towards Turkish waters where the Turkish Coast Guard apprehended the migrants. The FRO disproved migrant allegations of ill-treatment, engine damage, towing, and threats by Frontex and HCG personnel. However, the FRO identified significant flaws in operational reporting by Frontex crews and Greek authorities, including instructions not to report the incident and incorrect reporting of the initial sighting location.",

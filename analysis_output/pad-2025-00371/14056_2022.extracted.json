While Greek authorities stated the boat voluntarily altered course towards Turkish waters, video evidence and crew testimonies indicated physical contact and escorting by HCG in a northerly direction, suggesting an interception and potential pushback. The report highlights concerns about frequent allegations of pushbacks by HCG and a lack of transparency from Greek authorities.",

This practice is linked to a new national border management procedure from August 2021, which prevents asylum seekers from being admitted if they cross outside designated border crossing points. The Fundamental Rights Officer assesses these actions as likely violating several fundamental rights, including the right to asylum, prohibition of collective expulsion, non-refoulement, and right to life and human dignity, due to lack of individual assessment and effective access to asylum procedures, and the risk of chain-refoulement.",

An attempt to transport them to the camp failed because a group of Africans started a fire. Another large group of migrants descended from the camp to Vathy town to protest bad living conditions at the reception centre, heading towards Text Removed - Reporting Tools premises for registration, escorted by Text Removed - Reporting Tools. The situation in Samos Island hotspot was deteriorating with potential conflicts. By 19:00 LT in Vathy and 20:00 LT in the Samos hotspot, the situation returned to normal. Migrants were transported to the hotspot, and fingerprinting activities began.",

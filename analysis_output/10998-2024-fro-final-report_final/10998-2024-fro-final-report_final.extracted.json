Frontex identified its vessel (a Bulgarian asset) as the one in the videos and confirmed an encounter with the migrant boat. The NGO alleged that a Hellenic Coast Guard vessel towed the migrant boat to Turkish waters, destroyed its engine, and confiscated phones. Frontex noted that the alleged modus operandi is consistent with practices highlighted in previous SIRs involving the Hellenic Coast Guard. Greek authorities denied the allegations and refused to provide detailed responses. Frontex noted reporting gaps from its own staff.",

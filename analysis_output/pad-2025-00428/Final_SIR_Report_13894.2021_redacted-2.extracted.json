The Hellenic Coast Guard took over, and allegations arose of engine destruction and towing the boat to Turkish territorial waters. The Fundamental Rights Office notes similar methods by HCG in previous SIRs and expresses concern over attempts by Italian authorities to influence reporting. The Hellenic Coast Guard claims the boat moved towards Turkish waters on its own to avoid arrest. No corroborating evidence for engine destruction or towing was found, but if confirmed, it would constitute collective expulsion.",

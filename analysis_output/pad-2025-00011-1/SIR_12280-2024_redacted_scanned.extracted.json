While the Fundamental Rights Office could not verify the timeline of events, it considers it likely that the migrant group was subject to collective expulsion, and by being abandoned adrift at sea in a life raft, the Office considers it likely that their lives were at risk. It remains unclear whether the migrant boat was still in this position when the videos showing the encounter between the migrant boat and the coast guard vessel were recorded.",

The HCG CPB 604 vessel is identified as involved. The Office considers it likely that the migrant group was subject to collective expulsion and their lives were at risk by being abandoned adrift at sea in a life raft. Allegations of holding migrants at gunpoint, searching them, and taking belongings could not be verified, but the modus operandi is consistent with HCG practices. The Greek authorities' reporting of the incident is considered incorrect as it omitted key facts, and their response to the FRO's enquiry was deemed insufficient.",

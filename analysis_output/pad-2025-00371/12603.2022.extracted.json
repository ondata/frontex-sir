The FRO noted inconsistencies between Frontex and HCG reports. Greek authorities stated migrants voluntarily moved to TTW to avoid interception, a claim the FRO could not cross-check. The FRO could not exclude the possibility of voluntary movement but also noted the boat was stationary at handover. Both Frontex and Greek border guards perceived the boat was not in distress, though the presence of vulnerable persons remains unclear. The FRO regrets not receiving a reply from Greek authorities regarding the specifics of their actions.",

The migrant and cousin were arrested and later released, then crossed the Greek-Albanian border illegally. Albanian Police provided medical care, but a doctor found no external injuries. Hellenic authorities denied any maltreatment reports for the specified dates. FRO concluded that alleged facts could amount to serious breaches of fundamental rights but lacked sufficient corroborating evidence from Hellenic authorities to confirm or refute.",

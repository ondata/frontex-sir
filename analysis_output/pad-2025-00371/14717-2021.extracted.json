The report highlights potential violations of fundamental rights, including collective expulsion, degrading treatment, and lack of effective remedy, despite national authorities stating no evidence to corroborate the allegations. FRO emphasizes the risks in such incidents and recommends actions for Hellenic authorities and Frontex regarding transparency, training, safeguards, and potential deployment of Fundamental Rights Monitors.",

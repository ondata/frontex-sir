On 30/09/2024, one migrant fainted while being locked in a garage-like structure with other 30 migrants for at least 14 hours. It was also reported that the same day at around 17:00 at least 45 migrants were held in the garage, with 30 of them already being there no less than 20 hours. The Office considers it established that migrants were held in the garage adjacent to the main building of a BCU on a regular basis over 2023-2024, on occasion even up to 20 hours. The detention of migrants in such conditions, considering the general conditions of the garage, the size of migrant groups, and long waiting hours, likely amounts to degrading treatment.",

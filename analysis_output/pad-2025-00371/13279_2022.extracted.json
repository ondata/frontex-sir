The FRO found discrepancies between Frontex's report of an 'interception' and HCG's report of 'detection'. Despite HCG's claim that the migrants voluntarily altered course, the FRO concluded that a voluntary return was unlikely given evidence of physical contact between vessels and the skipper's actions. The FRO cannot exclude that Frontex Standing Corps Officers were implicated in a pushback by Greek authorities, highlighting concerns about reporting clarity and potential violations of fundamental rights, including collective expulsion and inhuman treatment. Greek authorities provided standardized, unspecific responses to detailed questions, using identical phrasing across multiple SIRs.",

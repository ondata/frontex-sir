NGO speedboats were rescuing eleven people when the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) performed dangerous manoeuvres and fired shots at close range. The Fundamental Rights Office considers this a frequent practice by Libyan authorities, posing risks to fundamental rights. This incident highlights the risks of sending alerts to the Libyan MRCC, leading to disembarkation in a country not considered a place of safety. Previous SIRs also document similar violent interceptions and ill-treatment by LCG.",

During their detention until the morning of 16/04, no food or drinking water was provided by local authorities or other actors, despite migrants claiming to have been without food for up to 84 hours. Frontex staff provided some water and biscuits from their own stocks. The Fundamental Rights Office concluded that the lack of provision amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment and possibly put lives at risk, due to a recent change in the UNHCR/Caritas agreement for food assistance.",

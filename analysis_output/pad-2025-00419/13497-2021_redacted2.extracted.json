Later, two Bulgarian border police officers arrived and allegedly pounded the man's head and kicked him in the leg. The Bulgarian authorities later claimed the person was a Bulgarian national, not a migrant, and denied the alleged use of force, contradicting the Frontex officer's account. The Fundamental Rights Office could neither confirm nor disprove the allegations due to conflicting reports.",

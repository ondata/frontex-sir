The migrant claimed he was shot by Bulgarian border police after his group was pushed back, following an argument over alleged 'sexual' searches of women. Mobile phone footage showed migrants throwing stones. The migrant stated Bulgarian officers fired shots, with one hitting him in the hand and chest. Bulgarian authorities denied firing shots from their side, stating the group was aggressive, threw stones, injured an officer, and damaged a vehicle. The Fundamental Rights Office considers it credible that shots were fired and a migrant was injured, but could not conclusively establish who was responsible.",

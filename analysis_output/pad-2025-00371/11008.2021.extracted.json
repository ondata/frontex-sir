      "context_note": "On 25 March 2021, 5 Algerian migrants arrived in Spain by boat. During screening in Almeria by Frontex staff, two showed signs of violence. One migrant had a bruise around his left eye without explanation. The second migrant, who could barely walk and had dry blood on his face and ears, reported being beaten by Guardia Civil personnel in San Jose (Almeria). The migrant refused to file a complaint. The Fundamental Rights Office (FRO) initiated an inquiry. Spanish authorities launched an internal investigation, reporting that two migrants were aggressive, one self-harmed, and they denied medical assistance. FRO found the Spanish authorities' information insufficient to corroborate or refute the allegations and recommended SIR closure, while emphasizing potential risks of such incidents and the importance of proper investigation and effective remedies.",

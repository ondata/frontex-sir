The family was issued formal decisions for refusal of entry and turned back to Belarus. Lithuanian authorities stated they had no record of an asylum application. The FRO notes concern about shrinking access to asylum procedures at Lithuania's borders and regrets that Lithuanian authorities decided not to investigate the incident.",

The migrant and their group were allegedly transferred to a detention center, photographed, and later transported to the Greek border. The Albanian authorities denied the collective expulsion, stating that the group was interviewed, photographed, fingerprinted, and issued an Order of Voluntary Removal on 13.03.2023, then 'left free in the territory of Albania'. The FRO notes discrepancies in dates and locations but finds the migrant's account relatively credible, consistent with previous SIRs regarding irregular returns by Albanian officers to Greece. The FRO concludes it is possible the group was irregularly returned to Greece by Albanian officers.",

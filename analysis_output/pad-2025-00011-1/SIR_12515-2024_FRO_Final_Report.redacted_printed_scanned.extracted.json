The Frontex officer described the injury as a severe dog bite on the migrant's left shoulder. The migrant was referred to a doctor, and a medical certificate confirmed an hematoma and wounds. However, the Bulgarian authorities denied the dog bite and stated no injuries from animal bites were found, though they confirmed the use of a service dog. The Fundamental Rights Office considers the migrant was injured but the cause of the injury is unclear, and cannot verify if excessive force was used.",

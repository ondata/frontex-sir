The Hellenic Coast Guard arrived, and the Danish asset departed. JRCC Piraeus informed MRCC Ankara. According to Greek authorities, a Turkish patrol boat took over the incident in Turkish territorial waters, and it was registered as a 'Prevention of Departure' by ICC Piraeus. A Danish National Official informed the FOC about a possible serious incident, and a SIR was later received from the Danish HELO by Frontex and Greek authorities. The incident was discussed in ICC Piraeus, where a misunderstanding regarding a request to change the reported location was noted. The Hellenic Coast Guard presented the event as a prevention of departure. Frontex is to launch a SIR procedure, as information indicates the migrant boat's possible location in Greek territorial waters within the JO Poseidon operational area, despite its reported conclusion on the Turkish side as a prevention of departure for unknown reasons.",

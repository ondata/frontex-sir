A Frontex officer observed bruises on the screened persons, and a photo showed one victim with a hand in plaster. Serbian authorities deny any record of the incident and state electro shockers are not standard equipment. Bulgarian authorities reported detaining a group of 7 on 26/11/2023 in a different location, which might be related to the initial group.",

The Fundamental Rights Office considers the statements of the alleged victims (one of whom the Office interviewed extensively) generally credible and consistent and further takes note of the observation of a Frontex officer who observed bruises on them. ... The Fundamental Rights Office concludes as possoble that a group of five persons was apprehended in Serbia by the Serbian police, and subsequently ill-treated, had personal belongings removed and finally was collectively expelled to Bulgaria.",

Lithuanian border guards apprehended the individual and subsequently redirected them to Belarus as a 'preventive measure' under national legislation. The Fundamental Rights Office concluded that this action, while aligned with national law, is incompatible with EU law and asylum policy, potentially constituting serious breaches of fundamental rights, including inhuman and degrading treatment, right to asylum, and non-refoulement, and poses a risk to Frontex's reputation. The FRO recommended that Frontex not participate in such activities and urged Lithuanian authorities to ensure effective access to asylum, define clear procedures for identifying vulnerable people, and conduct individual assessments to prevent refoulement.",

They informed Lithuanian border guards and following on from this, Lithuanian border guards apprehended the migrant. Lithuanian authorities later confirmed that preventive measures were applied, meaning that the migrant had been redirected from the territory of Lithuania back to Belarus.",

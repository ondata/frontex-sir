The HCG stated the boat was first sighted in Turkish territorial waters. Migrants were initially safe on the Greek patrol boat but were later placed back in a rubber boat, left adrift without propulsion, leading to a distress situation. This sequence of events indicates a strong possibility of fundamental rights violations and non-refoulement. HCG will be requested to conduct an internal investigation.",

However, FRO concluded the boat departed from Libya, was in the Maltese SRR, and some migrants rescued by the Libyan vessel were victims of ill-treatment by crew members. FRO acknowledges Frontex's contribution to SAR but underlines the importance of balancing saving lives with the risk of interacting with third-country authorities with poor human rights records, which could lead to disembarkation in unsafe ports like Libya. FRO notes similar cases of abuse by the Libyan Coast Guard in previous SIRs and suggests that information sharing could be indirect involvement in refoulement practices, with legal and reputational risks. FRO expresses concern at instances of violence recorded by Frontex surveillance aircraft, confirming two migrants were ill-treated by at least three crew members onboard the Libyan vessel, which may violate human dignity and prohibition of inhuman/degrading treatment.",

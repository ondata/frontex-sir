The boat was moving fast towards Chios Port. Migrants waved and shouted. Frontex assessed the boat was fully afloat, maneuverable, and not in distress. The Hellenic Coastguard (HCG) was called and took over the situation. Frontex observed the HCG vessel moving towards the Turkish borderline. No SAR operation was initiated, and no migrants were confirmed to have arrived in Chios on that day.",

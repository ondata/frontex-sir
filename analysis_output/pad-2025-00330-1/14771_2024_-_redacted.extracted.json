The boat initially headed north, then changed course south towards a container ship. Migrants attempted to disembark onto the container ship, during which the migrant boat sank. Frontex aircraft assisted in the search. Ultimately, 97 people were rescued, one body was recovered, and two people were declared missing. The SIR was launched to clarify the reasons for the rescue occurring several hours after initial detection.",

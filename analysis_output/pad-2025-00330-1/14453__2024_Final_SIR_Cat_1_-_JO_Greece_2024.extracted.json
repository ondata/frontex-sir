Migrants alleged HCG officers boarded their boat, broke down the engine, confiscated phones, tied the boat to the HCG vessel, and towed it to open sea despite rough weather. The boat capsized, resulting in one drowning and 14 survivors. The FRO considers the migrants' account credible and the interception, engine destruction, and towing likely. The capsizing is also considered likely due to HCG actions, potentially violating the right to life. Collective expulsion remains unclear due to insufficient information.",

Despite multiple attempts and prior notifications to Polish authorities, the family's wish to apply for international protection was disregarded, and they were denied entry without individual assessment or written decisions. The FRO concluded that this likely constitutes violations of the right to asylum, prohibition of collective expulsion, prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to an effective remedy. The family eventually entered Poland on 26/06/2024.",

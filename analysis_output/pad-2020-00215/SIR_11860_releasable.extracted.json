The Hellenic Coast Guard (HCG) arrived and took over, after which the Danish asset departed. JRCC Piraeus informed MRCC Ankara. According to Greek authorities, a Turkish patrol boat subsequently took responsibility for the incident in Turkish territorial waters, and ICC Piraeus registered it as a 'Prevention of Departure'. A Danish National Official (NO) reported a possible serious incident, questioning the reported location. Discussions in ICC Piraeus (JCB) referred to a misunderstanding, suggesting the request to change location was only for initial detection in Turkish TWs. Frontex is launching a SIR procedure due to information indicating a possible location in Greek territorial waters, despite the reported conclusion on the Turkish side as a prevention of departure.",

FRO identified 8 confirmed occasions where this militia intervened after Frontex sightings, including this event in the Maltese Search and Rescue Region, allegedly against instructions from Maltese authorities. FRO has consistently warned Frontex about human rights risks associated with interventions by Libyan actors, especially the Tareq Bin Zeyad group, known for severe fundamental rights violations. While Frontex is legally obliged to notify rescue coordination centers, FRO recommends strong safeguards to mitigate risks when sharing sightings, given the lack of human rights compliance by Libyan authorities and militias.",

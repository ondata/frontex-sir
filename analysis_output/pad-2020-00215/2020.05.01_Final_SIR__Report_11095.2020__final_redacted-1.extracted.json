The migrants were subsequently reloaded onto a rubber boat, which was then towed towards Turkish Territorial Waters. The rubber boat was later observed adrift without an engine. Greek authorities reported that the boat eventually landed safely on Turkish shores under TCG monitoring. The incident raised concerns about potential unprocessed return and violations of non-refoulement and fundamental rights.",

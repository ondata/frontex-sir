      "context_note": "An interview was performed with a male migrant apprehended in Vidin, who showed clear signs of physical abuse and violence. He claimed these injuries were from Croatian border guards. He reported multiple unsuccessful attempts to cross the border. During one attempt, a group of migrants (around thirty) was stopped by Croatian officers who beat them with police batons, confiscated valuables (phones), and left them standing for hours. They were then put into a truck, taken to a forest, and beaten again upon disembarking. The interviewee's friend allegedly suffered a dislocated shoulder. Previous attempts involved similar routes, with migrants being robbed, humiliated, and beaten, and children separated from mothers. The interviewee also claimed to have seen migrants drown in a river while trying to escape police brutality. FRO considers these allegations could amount to serious breaches of the right to life, integrity, asylum, human dignity, the prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, and collective expulsion, as well as a lack of access to an effective remedy.",

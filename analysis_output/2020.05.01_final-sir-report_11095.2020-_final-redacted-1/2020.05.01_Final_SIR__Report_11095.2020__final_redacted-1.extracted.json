The boat was later found adrift without an engine at 39°16′N 026°35'E after migrants were reportedly transferred from an HCG patrol vessel back to the rubber boat. The incident is suspected to have characteristics of an unprocessed return and violation of the principle of non-refoulement, although migrants eventually landed safely on Turkish shores.",

The FRO observes that while Article 15 ECHR allows derogations, it does not justify denying effective access to asylum or non-refoulement. Access to designated points appears neither genuine nor effective in practice, and no individual vulnerability assessment was conducted before returning migrants to Belarus, despite reports of mistreatment by Belarusian authorities. The FRO recommends administrative closure but notes the events may amount to serious breaches of fundamental rights.",

Specifically, Turkish military were helping traffickers to smuggle illegal immigrants into Greece in two boats. But when the boats started approaching to the Greek shore, there was an ambush of Greek Border Guards in the area, who, as is their custom in these cases, turned on powerful lenses to prevent the irregular migrants from reaching Greek shore. Seeing this situation, the Turkish army/police, in order not to allow the smugglers with the migrants to return back, fired at the boats. As a result, a woman was killed and there are also injured. The Local authorities confirmed the incident and the death of one woman from the shootings coming from the opposite side of the river. The case is under investigation by Hellenic Police authorities.",

Upon checking, one migrant was observed with a bloodshot eye, which was not present before processing. Two Spanish local police officers were also in the room. Migrants had recently arrived after being at sea. The Spanish Police authorities later stated that officers intervened because the migrant ignored COVID-19 safety measures and did not respect social distancing, claiming the migrant suffered no injury. This contradicts the initial observation of a bloodshot eye.",

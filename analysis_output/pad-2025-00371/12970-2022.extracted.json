Incidents include excessive use of force by escorts against one returnee (Returnee 1) during transport to the airport and in-flight, involving kicks and a chokehold while restrained, resulting in physical injuries (hyperemia, scratches, swelling, pain). Separately, a family reported physical and verbal abuse by police officers during transport to the airport, including forced sedatives on the woman. Another returnee (Returnee 2) raised concerns about access to medicine and an alleged asylum application, leading to the suspension of his return. The Fundamental Rights Office found the excessive force against Returnee 1 to be well-established and likely disproportionate, recommending investigation. For the family and Returnee 2's asylum claim, the FRO could not establish further details.",
